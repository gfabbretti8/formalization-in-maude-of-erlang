# A formalization in Maude of Erlang and the automatic generation of a reversible semantics

The purpose of the project is twofold: i) having a mechanized semantics of the Erlang programming language and ii) having an automatic method to derive a reversible mechanized semantics given a "standard" one.

Inside the folder `erlang-model` one can find the formalization of Erlang. 

Inside the folder `code-transformation` one can find the code to derive the reversible semantics given a forward one.
