# erlang-verifier

This is academic code meant to model (part of) the Erlang language. 
This project is heavily reusing what has been already done by Martin Neuhaeusser at: https://github.com/martin-neuhaeusser/erlang-verifier 


The code is dirty, far from clean and polished and comments are missing, this must be considered the smallest possible running example.
